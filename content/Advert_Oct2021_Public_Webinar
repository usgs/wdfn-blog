Access to water data is crucial for decision-making, and you can do amazing things with [@USGS_Water](https://twitter.com/USGS_water) data. But, our previous system didn't make data access easy, so we’re [rebuilding our data delivery system](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/realtime-pages-replacement/). 
At USGS, we know it's crucial for water data to be accessible, usable, and discoverable for all US citizens. We’d like to tell you all about how we’re prioritizing better data delivery so you have the information you need to make important decisions. To hear more of the story, watch our brief introduction video, available on [our website](https://www.usgs.gov/media/videos/introduction-water-data-nations-next-generation-monitoring) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0UnEH1l-Yg).
