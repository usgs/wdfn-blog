## To learn more about these changes, attend our [public webinar on October 13th, 2021 at 1 pm EDT / 10 am PDT](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/webinar-10-13-21/).



# Everything you need to know 



## What are Monitoring Location Pages? 

Monitoring location pages are web pages that the USGS Water Mission Area offers to display important water data like discharge (also referred to as streamflow), gage height, precipitation, water-levels, temperature, etc. Thousands of people use USGS water data each month to make decisions ranging from recreation to emergency management.

</div>
 

## Why Are We Changing Them? 

### Thanking Outdated Technology 

The original monitoring location pages have largely looked the same '[since their inception in 1995](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/25-years-of-water-data-on-the-web/)'. We are confident they were one of the first displays of real-time water-data anywhere in the world at a time when the web was only 5 years old and rarely displayed “live” content of any kind. Wow! 

The technology used to produce the original pages, what we call legacy pages, is now outdated, and prevents crucial updates from being made. But we need to meet accessibility standards, stay modern, and increase user satisfaction, so we have created '[new, Next Generation monitoring location pages](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-tng/)'. We give thanks to the decades of skilled software-programming work put into the legacy pages and we recognize how much they have provided to the public. We are thrilled to modernize our water data delivery as we “go live” with the NextGen pages.

<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/NextGen_Go_Live/LegacyPage_LongGreen.PNG" caption="Here’s an example of a legacy page, showing '[monitoring location 01584050 LONG GREEN CREEK AT GLEN ARM, MD](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=01584050)'." alt="Screen capture of a legacy monitoring location page for 01584050 LONG GREEN CREEK AT GLEN ARM, MD." >}}
</div> 

## What Does “Live” Mean? When will "Live" happen? 

NextGen pages have been online and accessible for approximately two years, in what we have called the beta stage of our agile development process. Beta means the pages are accessible to the public and available for user testing. During beta, we have made many changes. 

NextGen pages are fully accessible today. We’re encouraging traffic to be directed to the NextGen pages over NWISWeb’s legacy pages. NextGen monitoring location pages will be linked to from other USGS websites. Search engines will prioritize NextGen pages over legacy pages in search results.

Legacy real-time pages will be on a path to being turned off entirely, and in March of 2022, the legacy real-time pages will be redirected to NextGen pages, but you can still get to the legacy real-time pages if you need them.

In January 2023, legacy real time pages will be fully decommissioned and no longer available. There are lots of other legacy pages that will still be available for awhile longer, but in January 2023 there will be no more legacy real-time pages.

<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/NextGen_Go_Live/Agile_Process.PNG" caption="The Agile Development Process as the WDFN team uses it." alt="4 part chart that goes from left to right describing the agile process. The four steps are discovery, alpha, beta, and live." >}}
</div>  

## Pages Continue to Improve 

### Keep the feedback coming! #WeHearYou 

During this beta phase of the next generation pages, '[we asked you, the user, how these pages could better serve you](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/improvingmonitoringpages/)'. Pages will continue to be improved iteratively to create discoverable, accessible, and usable Water Data for the Nation, and your feedback is always welcome.

### How We Work 

Learn more about how we work and use the agile development process to display high quality water information. Discover how we’ve improved the pages so far. 

 

## How Are NextGen Pages Different from Legacy Pages? 

These NextGen pages have new features, offering more than just a 1:1 replacement of legacy pages.

### 5 Key Differences 

<b>Data-first:</b> Hydrograph at top, except for key alerts 

<b>Interactive:</b> Featuring a clickable, zoomable hydrograph with the ability to compare prior data 

<b>Compact & Mobile-First:</b> More things on one page – monitoring location metadata, water-data inventory, groundwater data, interactive map, etc, all summarized on one page 

<b>Geo-located:</b> Featuring a map with flowlines, shaded watershed area, and nearby monitoring locations 

<b>Affiliated networks:</b> A monitoring location belong to larger groupings of monitoring locations, and these pages let you explore those groupings to see the bigger picture of water resources
